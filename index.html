                <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm <block id="maleka">Kacper</block> üëã</h1>
                <p>
                    I‚Äôm a tech enthusiast with a strong background in web development, design, and IT solutions. My
                    programming journey began at the age of 12, starting with Scratch during school IT classes, and has
                    since grown into a deep passion for creating and managing websites, web applications, and databases.
                    In 2022, I successfully passed the <b>EE.08</b> / <b>INF.02</b> professional qualification exams,
                    further solidifying my technical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since November 2024, I have been part of the <a href="https://rybizak.cz"
                        target="_blank">Ryb√≠z√°k</a> team as a sales stand operator, where I take care of customers,
                    handle transactions, prepare documentation for stock replenishment, and ensure smooth daily
                    operations. Alongside this, I work at <a href="https://globus.cz" target="_blank">Globus</a> as a
                    cashier, operating both staffed and self-service checkouts, assisting customers, managing store
                    opening and closing procedures, and training new colleagues when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside my formal roles, I frequently help friends and neighbors with small tech-related tasks ‚Äî
                    whether it‚Äôs reinstalling Windows, setting up applications, configuring security cameras, or
                    troubleshooting everyday PC issues. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving abilities
                    and taught me the value of clear communication with both technical and non-technical users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am fluent in Polish (native) and communicate effectively in English and Czech at an
                    upper-intermediate level (ILR scale 3‚Äì4). When I‚Äôm not coding or working, I enjoy gaming, running my
                    online community, exploring new technologies, and spending time with friends.
                </p>
                <div class="card-footer">
                    That‚Äôs me in a nutshell. Thanks for stopping by üíô

                    While I‚Äôm still growing as a developer, I have several projects I‚Äôm proud of and would like to

                    active members, with its invite link used more than 900 times. I also developed its dedicated

                    serves as a hub for members to connect and stay updated.
